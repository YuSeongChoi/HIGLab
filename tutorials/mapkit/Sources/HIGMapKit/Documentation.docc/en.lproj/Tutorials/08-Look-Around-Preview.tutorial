                **Checking Look Around Availability**
                
                Look Around is not available in all regions.
                Check availability with MKLookAroundSceneRequest.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundService.swift", file: "08-availability-check.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                **Requesting a Scene**
                
                Fetch an MKLookAroundScene based on coordinates.
                Handle asynchronously with async/await.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundService.swift", file: "08-scene-request.swift")
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "LookAroundPreview View") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Display a preview using LookAroundPreview 
            in SwiftUI.
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                **Displaying Basic Preview**
                
                Pass the scene to LookAroundPreview.
                The panorama image loads automatically.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundView.swift", file: "08-basic-preview.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                **Styling the Preview**
                
                Set size and shape with .frame and .clipShape.
                Create a card-style preview.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundView.swift", file: "08-preview-style.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                **Configuring Interaction**
                
                Control UI elements and navigation with 
                .badgePosition and .allowsNavigation.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundView.swift", file: "08-interaction.swift")
            }
        }

    @Section(title: "Full-Screen Look Around") {

            Switch to a full-screen Look Around viewer on tap.
            Provide an immersive street exploration experience.
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                **Full-Screen Viewer**
                
                Display full-screen Look Around with .fullScreenCover.
                Users can freely explore in 360°.
                
                @Code(name: "LookAroundView.swift", file: "08-fullscreen.swift")
            }
            
            @Step {
                **Integrating with Restaurant Detail**
                
                Add Look Around preview to the restaurant detail screen.
                Display a fallback image when not available.
                
                @Code(name: "RestaurantDetailView.swift", file: "08-detail-integration.swift")
            }

            @Choice(isCorrect: true) {
                Request a scene with MKLookAroundSceneRequest and check for nil
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Correct!") {
                    If scene is nil, it means Look Around is not 
                    available at that location.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {

                @Justification(reaction: "Not quite") {
                    That property doesn't exist.
                    You must use MKLookAroundSceneRequest.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                Configure the region in Info.plist
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Not quite") {
                    Look Around availability is determined by regions Apple has photographed.
                    It cannot be controlled through app settings.
                }

                    Setting allowsNavigation to false 
                    displays only a static preview.

                    In SwiftUI, use the .allowsNavigation modifier.

                    .disabled disables the entire view.
                    Use .allowsNavigation to control only navigation.
