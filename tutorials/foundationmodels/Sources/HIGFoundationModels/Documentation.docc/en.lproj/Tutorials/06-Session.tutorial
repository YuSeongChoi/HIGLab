        Use Session to manage multi-turn conversations and maintain conversation context.

        @ContentAndMedia {
            `Session` manages the conversation history between the user and the model. 
            It enables natural multi-turn conversations by maintaining conversation context.
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Create a Session and define the model's role with a system prompt.
                @Code(name: "Session.swift", file: "06-session.swift")
            }
        }

    @Section(title: "Using Conversation History") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            You can save and restore session conversation history to continue conversations.
        }

                How to save conversation history and restore it in a new session.
                @Code(name: "SessionPersistence.swift", file: "06-session-persistence.swift")

    @Assessments {
        @MultipleChoice {
            What is the role of the system prompt in a Session?
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: true) {
                It defines the model's behavior and role
                @Justification(reaction: "Correct!") {
                    The system prompt determines how the model responds throughout the conversation.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                It replaces the user's first message
                @Justification(reaction: "Think again.") {
                    The system prompt is separate from user messages and sets the model's behavior.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                It deletes conversation history
                @Justification(reaction: "Think again.") {
                    The system prompt does not affect conversation history.
                }
            }
        }
        
        @MultipleChoice {
            Why is maintaining context important in multi-turn conversations?
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                It increases the model's response speed
                @Justification(reaction: "Think again.") {
                    Context maintenance is related to conversation consistency rather than speed.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: true) {
                It enables consistent responses by referencing previous conversation content
                @Justification(reaction: "Correct!") {
                    The model needs to remember previous conversations to understand references like "that" or "what you said earlier."
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                It reduces memory usage
                @Justification(reaction: "Think again.") {
                    Actually, maintaining context requires more memory.
                }
            }
        }
    }
